Submitting Patches
------------------
Patches are always welcome!  Please send pull requests with your patches!  If at all possible please rebase your
repository before sending a pull request.  You can do this by using the following command:

    git pull --rebase git://github.com/CyanogenMod/path_to_project.git gingerbread

This makes accepting patches MUCH easier for our comitters.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/CyanogenMod, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the CyanogenMod trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b gingerbread

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see the [CyanogenMod Wiki](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/) for building instructions.

For more information on this Github Organization and how it is structured, 
please [read the wiki article](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php/Github_Organization)

Buildbot
--------

All supported devices are built nightly and periodically as changes are committed to ensure the source trees remain buildable.

You can view the current build statuses at [buildbot.teamdouche.net](http://buildbot.teamdouche.net/)
